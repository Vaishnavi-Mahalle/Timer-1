# Timer-1
I developed an timer using flutter.
this is the timer using dart languag ,in flutter.
in which we can set the time upto 10min.after
each 10min it will again reset  to 0.
this app is  developed by using dart language in android studio.
here i used Cupertino button for onclick start and onclick stop.
there is use of direct inbuilt function for the timer from flutter.

Accuracy: 100 %
